# title(){return this.options.title||this.options.name}

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

## Knowledge to work on project
 
Javascript, React fundamentals are must to work on this project. Webpack fundamentals can be ignored for now. I would reccommend utilizing create-react-app module to create React Webpages initially. Webpack utilization is a bit more advanced.
